# Crypto Price Checker - Practice - node.js

> quick way to check crypto prices

Fun project that I always saw everyone build and just wanted to try it out for myself after learning node.js. I hope to update it a little more to make it a little more userfriendly in the near future.

## How to use

This was a quick project that I threw up, and is not too user friendly in its current state. The program only takes in abreviations for both arguments.

> for examples: bitcoin -> BTC

The app takes two arguments:

1. The crypto currency that you want to get the proce of.
1. The currency that you want to convert it to.

```basch
    node app.js (crypto) (currency)
```
